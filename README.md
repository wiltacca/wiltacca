- :wave: Hi, my name is William Tan.

- :pushpin: I am a Data Science and Machine Learning Enthusiast!

- :mega: I am currently pursuing AI for Industry (AI4I) online programme at my own learning pace.

- :triangular_flag_on_post: My more than 10-year career in accounting & finance is chronicled by consistent achievements cemented around these strengths:

- :bell: As a business intelligence and insights expert, I possess the ability to mine, manipulate and analyse large quantities of data to improve decision-making. With a knack for articulating compelling business cases, I connect the dots and expertly look for trends, themes and the big picture.  

- :bell: As an analytical number cruncher, I support commercial activities by performing project profitability analysis to catapult an early head start in the competitive bidding procedure. I apply quantitative financial analysis, statistical models and valuation tools and techniques to make recommendations on risk coverage and craft strategies to minimise the impact of risks on tenders and projects. I run an accurate sensitivity and what-if analysis on preferential solutions across variations in key parameters to determine the level of risk and returns involved in large-scale projects and initiatives.

- :bell: As an astute problem solver, I gather and analyse data on current and future trends of best practices within the finance department and beyond. Actively seeking information on issues impacting organisational progress, I collect and convert information into continuous improvement activities that optimise performance. I have a track record of voluntarily taking the first steps to identify and address existing and potential obstacles, issues and opportunities. 

- :bell: As a P&L maximiser, I have the ability to understand the financial implications and impact of different change initiatives on the organisation’s bottom line. I am capable of developing and presenting cost/benefit analysis and identifying potential trade-offs among competing initiatives. I am able to provide relevant insights into alternative solutions’ financial payoffs, milestones, break-even points and revenue potential in the short, medium and long term.  

- :bell: As an articulate communicator, I excel in driving consensus and finding a common solution that strikes a balance between the competing priorities of project stakeholders. I have the political acumen required to present ideas, solicit input, negotiate a compromise, influence decisions and garner the support of senior-level executives, stakeholders and process owners in terms and manners that will be well received and provide desired results.
